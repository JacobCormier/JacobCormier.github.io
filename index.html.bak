			  About Me
			</h4>
			<p class = "about-me-paragraph">
				I am an enthuastic game developer and designer, with excellent interpersonal communication skills and a thirst to create. Making games has always been something I've been drawn to in all forms, from becoming a Game Master for Dungeons & Dragons, to programming my first game and all that have come after it, creating a fun experience for my players is an addicting feeling, that I have come across in no other career.
				<br>
				<br>
				When I am not scratching my head over bugs in my code you can find me with my rogue of a cat Mochi, as he steals every blanket in the house and hordes them like a dragon.

			<p class = "about-me-paragraph">
				I live in New Brunswick, Canada where I spend my most of my days programming, consuming music, games, and film, reorganizing blankets and spending time with family.
